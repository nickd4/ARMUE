-------------- Current Process ----------------------------------------------
Completing the core function of the emulator mentioned above, especially the arm v7m instruction set and memory map.

-------------- Developing Enviroment ----------------------------------------
The source is currently developed and tested under Windows 7 64 bit and Visual Stdio 2010  and will be ported to Linux with gcc in the future.
